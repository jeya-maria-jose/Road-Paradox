# Machine Vision Assisted Elimination of Traffic using Intelligent Control

The traffic density on roads has been on an exponential 
rise since the advent of automobile revolution. Since
then there has been some approaches for traffic management
such as traffic light control based on load, traffic density
calculation based on IR etc. An efficient algorithm using image
processing techniques and intelligent control is proposed to
completely obliterate traffic. The prototype has been developed
and successfully tested using a miniature model of a rover and a
wall mounted camera. In real time environments, this setup is
analogous to cars with GPS and satellite cameras giving live
traffic data on roads. The algorithm works in such a way that the
vehicles are tuned to move at a calculated speed at which they
avoid stopping at traffic signals which leads to reduction of
traffic. This approach also helps us in the reduction of vehicle
particulate emissions and improving the fuel efficiency, battery
life in case of electric vehicles.
